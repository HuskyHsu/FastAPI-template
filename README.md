## How to set environment

Create the virtualenv inside the project’s root directory.
```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
[virtualenvs.in-project](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#virtualenvsin-project)

The shell command spawns a shell, according to the $SHELL environment variable, within the virtual environment. If one doesn’t exist yet, it will be created.
```
poetry shell
```

The install command reads the pyproject.toml file from the current project, resolves the dependencies, and installs them.
```
poetry install
```

## How to use it

```
poetry run start
```
